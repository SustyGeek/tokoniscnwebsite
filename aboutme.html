        <p>Hi, my name is Tokoni and I write poetry.
            <br>
            Here's my story...<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Tl;dr: Voices in my head tell me poems, and I write them down. </i> <br> <br>
            <br>
            I’ve been hearing voices, before all I heard was silence… <br>
            Or maybe not silence, maybe I just wasn’t paying attention to the voices in my head, the voices reciting poetry.<br>
            I’ll never forget the first time I remember paying attention to the voices in my head.<br>
            Close your eyes,<br>
            <br>
            Picture this:<br>
            It’s the middle of the day,<br>
            There’s a boy seated by the window of a sun-lit Fine Art lab.<br>
            The day is bright, it’s bright and fair; a normal day like every other day before that day.<br>
            The boy is surrounded by people, not so much though, but these people include at least one classmate of his and the Fine Art teacher.<br>
            The boy his ~8 years old, he’s in Year 8.<br>
            The boy reads a lot, and maybe he’s reading now as he’s seated by the window;<br>
            When suddenly he opens his mouth and begins to recite this poem:<br>
            <br>
            <i>I was going to the market,<br>
            One early Winter morning<br>
            When I saw a little bunny<br>
            Sticking out it’s little tail.<br>
            Then I saw it do it a wiggle<br>
            And it ran around a spot;<br>
            But I have to keep on going<br>
            Because mother told me to.<br></i>
            <br>
            The boy doesn’t know it but he’s just written his first poem.<br>
            The thing is he didn’t write it down and he didn’t actually recite it, he sang it.<br>
            <br>
            Literally out of nowhere, that poem came to me.<br>
            You see, mostly as a result of voices in my head that speak to me without my volition, I have been writing poetry since I was 8.
