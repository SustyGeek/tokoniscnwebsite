        <p class="center"> To that piece of plantain that fell face flat <br>
            En route between the frying pan <br>
            And flat plate, laced with a kitchen paper towel <br>
            To soak up the oil, <br>
            I will need a full roll of kitchen paper towels to soak up <br>
            My tears shed over the fact that you fell, splat! <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I would have picked you up at once had I noticed, <br>
            But I was self-absorbed thinking about eating, <br>
            And so absorbed with flipping the other plantain pieces <br>
            That I let you fall between the cracks of my vision, <br>
            And for that I am sorry. <br>
            And I’m sorry I let the devil get to you <br>
            After the count of three. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Four and a quarter years later, <br>
            Do you know, I still lay awake at night thinking about you? <br>
            You were the one that got away, <br>
            The plantain piece that took my breath away, <br>
            From all that frying. <br>
            But I’d be lying if I said I haven’t moved on;<br>
            There’s a whole bunch of plantains in the fridge <br>
            Right now as we speak. <br>
            And, over the years, <br>
            I have worked my way through enough bunches <br>
            To mend my broken stomach.

        Things will be better next year,<br>

        The weather will be nice,<br>
        we’ll run around like mice;<br>
        and we’ll be okay.<br>
        Maybe not today,<br>

        this pandemic shit will be done.
